# NotCake

<!-- <img src="./imgs/Neurons-Network_T.jpg"> -->

<h2><a name="about">About</a></h2>  
NotCake is an iOS App which uses Artificial Intelligence to detect cake using a phoneâ€™s camera. The App works by using a pretrained Convolutional Neural Network for object recognition. This is project is currently under development. And as such, the specifications will remain confidential until the App is set for early release.  

This repository will hold both the underlying Deep Neural Network along with the Swift 5 code used to create the application.

The pipeline which will be included and fully documented in this repository will consist of:

The underlying object detection algorithm was made using Python and various Python libraries including, but not limited to: TensorFlow, Keras, Numpy, cv2, PIL, etc. A full list of libraries, and the version used, will be included upon completion of the project.  

<!-- All scripts are written in Python3. The following libraries (and their version) were also used:   -->

<!-- * NumPy 1.15.3  
* ObsPy 1.1.0  
* Pandas 0.23.0  
* Keras (on top of TensorFlow)  2.2.4  
* TensorFlow 1.8.0  
* Matplotlib   -->
