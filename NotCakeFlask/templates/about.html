      	<h3>What is This?</h3>
      	<p>NotCake is a Flask web application that uses Artificial Intelligence to detect whether an image contains instances of cake. The application works by using a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network for object recognition. More specifically, NotCake works by using a YOLO detection algorithm. To ensure the application doesn’t take more than a minute to run, the NotCake App is currently using an out-of-the-box, pre-trained MobileNet weight. The developer trained their own algorithm but the detection accuracy is not optimal (yet).</p>
      	<p>This is project is currently under development. Currently, the application can take an uploaded photo and make predictions. A future release will allow the user to take a photo with the NotCake App directly.</p>
      	
      	<br>
      	
      	<h3>How Does This Work?</h3>
      	<p>The pre-release version of NotCake requires users to upload images into the "imageDetect" folder (I know, this is lame). Once you have loaded your images, click the “Carbe Diem” button to initiate YOLO detection algorithm.</p>

      	<h3>Who Made This?</h3>
	    <p>The NotCake App was created for kicks and giggles by Noah G. Luna. It was inspired by the "NotHotDog App" mentioned on HBO's hit sitcome, "Silicon Valley".</p>
	    <p>Noah is still unemployed as of making this application. Feel free to reach out to them with a job offer, career advice, or coffee. Hugs are welcomed, too.</p>
